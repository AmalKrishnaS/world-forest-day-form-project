# world-forest-day-form-project

`Overview`  
An HTML form for signing up for a tree-planting event on World Forest Day. This project helped me learn HTML forms and their styling.  

`Things I Learned`    
- Structuring and styling HTML forms.  
- Controlling box sizes without height for better flexbox layouts.  
- Improved understanding of flexbox, pseudo-classes, box-shadow, and outline.  
- Gained a deeper understanding of CSS.
